                    Swedish artist Mio Linzie designed the rainbow jerseys.
                    The crest of the jersey features swords and a compass 
                    rose. The swords represent the story of "wandering 
                    and coming home in Vegas." The compass rose 
                    represents the city, nature, hockey and the 
                    queer community coming together in a golden light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The jerseys are set to be auctioned off with 
                    the proceeds benefiting Henderson Equality 
                    Center, a local center that supports at-risk 
                    LGBTQ youths and adults.
