                <p>
                    Michelle Jacquet Branch (born July 2, 1983) is 
                    an American singer, songwriter and guitarist.

                    top-selling albums: The Spirit Room and 
                    Hotel Paper. She won a Grammy Award for 
                    Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals with 
                    Santana for their 2002 single, "The Game of Love".
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a solo recording artist, she signed to 
                    Madonna's Maverick record label in early 
                    2001, and released her debut album The 
                    Spirit Room later that year. The album 
                    contained the hit singles "Everywhere" 
                    and "All You Wanted" and was followed 
                    up with Hotel Paper in 2003. In 2005, 
                    she formed the country music duo the 
                    Wreckers with Jessica Harp, and 
                    produced the Grammy-nominated single 
                    "Leave the Pieces". The Wreckers 
                    disbanded in 2007 to pursue their 
                    respective solo careers. Since then, 
                    she has released extended plays 
                    in 2010 and 2011, and a third solo 
                    album, Hopeless Romantic in 2017. 
                    Her fourth studio album, The Trouble 
                    with Fever, was released in 2022.

                    Branch was born on July 2, 1983, in 
                    Sedona, Arizona,[1][2][3] to David 
                    and Peggy Branch.[4] Her father is 
                    of partial Irish ancestry, and her 
                    mother is of Dutch-Indonesian ("Indo") 
                    and French descent.[4][5] Her maternal 
                    grandmother was held in a Japanese 
                    internment camp during World War II. 
                    After the war she moved to Holland, 
                    where Branch's mother was born. Her 
                    mother was five years old when the 
                    family moved from the Netherlands 
                    to Arizona.[5][6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her siblings include an older half-brother 
                    named David and a younger sister named Nicole.

                    Beginning to sing at the age of three, 
                    Branch enrolled in voice lessons at 
                    Northern Arizona University when she 
                    was eight,[4][7][8] and received her 
                    first guitar for her 14th birthday.
                    [2][3][8] After teaching herself 
                    chords, she composed her first 
                    song "Fallen" within a week of 
                    receiving her guitar.[9] She 
                    initially attended Sedona Red 
                    Rock High School,[7] but 
                    finished the last two years of 
                    her high school education through 
                    home schooling so that she could 
                    focus on her music career.[8]

                    Branch married her bass player Teddy Landau 
                    (b. 1964) in Mexico on May 23, 2004,[2][23][65] 
                    and gave birth to a child[66] in August 2005.[67] 
                    Branch separated from Landau in 2014,[68] 
                    and their divorce was finalized in November 
                    2015.[69][70]

                <p>
                    In 2015, Branch met Patrick Carney of the Black 
                    Keys at a Grammy party, and the two started 
                    dating during the production of Hopeless 
                    Romantic.[71][72] In 2017, Branch and her 
                    child moved into Carney's home in Nashville.
                    [73][74] Branch and Carney have a son, 
                    who was born in August 2018.[75][76] 
                    The couple lived in Nashville with their 
                    children and two Irish Wolfhounds.[77] 
                    Branch and Carney were married on 
                    April 20, 2019.[78] In December 2020, 
                    she revealed she suffered a miscarriage.
                    [79] In August 2021, Branch announced 
                    she was pregnant,[80] and in February 2022, 
                    she gave birth to a daughter, her 
                    third child and her second with Carney.
                    [81] On August 11, 2022, Branch 
                    announced her separation from Carney 
                    after accusing him of infidelity.[82] 
                    She was arrested on a domestic assault 
                    charge the next day, having allegedly 
                    slapped Carney.[83] Billboard reported 
                    that the charges against Branch were 
                    dropped at the request of the 
                    state on August 24.[84] The following 
                    month, Branch and Carney filed to 
                    suspend their divorce proceedings.[66][85]

                    To support Branch's interests, her parents 
                    helped her book local gigs in Sedona, and 
                    later financed her independent album Broken 
                    Bracelet.[8] Her set list at these gigs 
                    included covers of songs by Sheryl Crow, 
                    Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and Fleetwood Mac.[9]

                    In December 1999, she posted two of her 
                    songs on the Rolling Stone website, which 
                    caught the attention of both pop rock band 
                    Hanson and former Rolling Stone writer and 
                    Los Angeles record producer Jeff Rabhan, 
                    eventually leading to two gigs opening for 
                    Hanson in 2000.[4]

                    In June 2000, Branch self-produced Broken 
                    Bracelet,[4] a compilation of songs she 
                    wrote starting from when she was 14;[5] 
                    the album was released on the independent 
                    record label Twin Dragon Records.[4][5] 
                    Its title was inspired from a bracelet 
                    made by pop singer Jewel, given to Branch 
                    by musician Steve Poltz at a Lisa Loeb 
                    concert she attended. Poltz told Branch 
                    that "when it breaks, you'll be famous."
                    [4] The Broken Bracelet recordings were 
                    destroyed in the Nashville floods in May 2010.[10]
