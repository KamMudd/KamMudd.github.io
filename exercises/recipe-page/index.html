            What happens when you combine the crispiness of a 
            Mexican taco with the flavors of Japanese sushi? 
            You get the most incredible creation - a sushi taco 
            - and I'm sure this is what Hannah Montana meant when 
            she said the best of both worlds. These tacos are the 
            most delicious fusion twist packed with spicy ahi tuna 
            and creamy homemade spicy mayo, all nestled in crispy 
            nori taco shells. It's a fun and flavorful way to enjoy 
            your favorite sushi but handheld in a seaweed tempura taco!
